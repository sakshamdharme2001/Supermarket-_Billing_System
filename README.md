# Supermarket_Billing_System
This C++ program simulates a grocery store management system where customers can browse and purchase grocery items, while shop owners can manage the inventory. The system includes a GroceryItem class for representing items such as fruits, vegetables, and daily essentials with names and prices. The GroceryStore class manages the items, allowing owners to add, remove, or edit items, and customers to add items to their cart and check out. The program allows two user roles: a customer who can shop and a shop owner who can manage the store's inventory. The user interface is menu-driven, and prices are displayed in rupee.
